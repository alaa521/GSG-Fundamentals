### The problem :
 
 Many people face various difficulties in choosing a book or reaching some details about any topic they need to read about it. For some reasons, they can not visit a library so we have created this website for them and for every person who needs some ease to find them in reach.
 
### The solution :
The electronic library simplifies searching techniques for specific books and works in order to provide various information resources to people through both direct and indirect methods.

### User Journey :
Our website has four pages as following:
First page lets the users start and have an overview of the website. It includes two buttons; one to go to the library and the other takes users to the second page, the quotation page, which shows short quotes.
Third one presents sets of books and different information resourses.
Fourth page allows the users to search for available topics and books./
